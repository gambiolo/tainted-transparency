In 2015 we had the opportunity to gather brillant minds around the table at SXSW, We curated lectures and workshops with Bruce Sterling as techno-Shaman in chief distibuting punches to Joi Ito ex guru and director at the MIT medialab. Also George Church (god complex) was supposed to be here...Sadly George and his god complex could not attempt the event and never showed up. 

Wine was definetly poored into Bruce's glass, and Joi Ito called us ''trouble makers'' pop corn at hand, the show could begin.


At the end of this rather interesting discussion Bruce Sterling suddenly shouted to the Joi Ito out of the nowhere ''you're not a community untill you face your dark side'' as if wine was kicking in. 

Realy by now this tweet should be minted as an NFT (alcohol is bad for health kids)

Most kids accepting grants from corporations at MIT medialab have never been trained in any critical or political theories, partly because they are realy young and virgin in thoughts.  

As soon as these priviledged individuals are confronted with reality, they turn a blind eye to it. A big part of mistrust in journalism and academia comes from a lack of transparency within fundings, even thought transparency is at the core of these institutional narratives, it blurs the line of what truth is. 

Transparency is an 18 century concept rarely revised in western culture, if you can see thru a glass for instance then it's transparent, but you do not see the thing you are suposed to see, you just see thru it. Transparency hides the physical structure, just as much as the structural fascist/neoliberal/collonial structures that uses transparency as a way to hide in plain sight.

### open source / transparency / inclusivity / diversity 

Glass is hard and transparent, but can easily break in pieces and we wish to have avoid all the dramamatic fractals with Joi Ito having to resign from the medialab etc... Using media and academia to hide the truth creates more conspiracies than ever. Our time is precious and your generation's behaviour is toxic, kids are watching.
